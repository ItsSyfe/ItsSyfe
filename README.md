    <p align="left">I do development on some small projects, most of which I eventually lose interest in but currently I'm working on <a href="https://yutashi.xyz">Yutashi</a>.<br><br>Yutashi is a simple project that aims to open up ease of access to readily made profile pictures and banners for Discord, we want to eventually have a community of users that provide us with a wealth of profile themes and a good moderation team to be able to keep our focus just on development of Yutashi.</p>
